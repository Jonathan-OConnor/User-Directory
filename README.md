# User-Directory

## Description
This is a basic application made using React. The app pulls 200 random individuals from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) and builds a chart which is populated with information about these people. The user of the application can then search by the name of the individual or sort the list alphabetically. The chart of individuals changes dynamically depending on the search of the user.
